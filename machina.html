			<p>Duo Et Machina is a partner project with Ryan Gulland for the 2017 MIT Trashion Show. We wanted to introduce a mechanical engineering aspect to the world of fashion and thus designed our pieces solely with machine shop scraps. The two outfits are made of a combination of sheet metal scraps from various machine shops on campus and 3D knitter scraps donated to us from The Ministry of Supply on Newbury Street.</p>

			<p>I modelled a crop top and a skirt that was decorated with shards of bent sheet metal. The outfit was completed by a backpiece that protruded from behind; the shards were spot-welded to each other and then welded onto a shoulder piece that connected to a spine. The spine screwed onto the outfit at two different points, up by the neck with the choker and down by the skirt with the belt. The collar and the belt were lined with the knitted fabric for maximum comfort and each piece was dyed black.</p>

			<p>Ryan modelled a jacket made from the knitted fabric and interwoven with shards of sheet metal that stuck out at angles from the left shoulder and the right hip. The shards were spot-welded together, and screwed onto the jacket through a belt and a single suspender strap, both made of sheet metal.</p>

			<p>The pieces won second-place overall for the fashion show, out of 26 entries, and the prize for Most Unexpected Materials.</p>

			<p>We first made sketches of the designs we wanted and then prototyped using cardboard. Fabrication involved shears, brakes, and presses to cut, bend, and punch the sheet metal, as well as needle and thread to hand-sew the fabric. Here are some snippets of the work in progress:</p>

			<p>Very early on in the sketching cycle, we had hit upon the ideas we wanted. I was very much into the idea of spikes coming off of the shoulders in a neckpiece reminiscent of the Iron Throne. Ryan was pro cascading spikes going into and off of the lapel. The main problem was how to incorporate the metal pieces into the garment. Scrap metal is heavy and dangerous, and we needed to find a way to attach the metal pieces that was at once aesthetically pleasing, physically sound, and completely safe. This involved thinking over force and load distributions. For the neckpiece, we settled on a backpiece that spanned my shoulderblades with a spine that ran the length of my back. The piece was attached to me through a collar at my neck and a belt at my waist. The span of the backpiece distributed the weight so that it was not tugging at the collar and therefore choking me. The attachment at the neck was necessary so that the piece wouldn't buckle; the attachment at the waist was necessary so that the load was distributed.</p>

			<p>For Ryan's outfit, we decided on a visible belt this time and a single suspender. The belt allowed for the attachment of the bottom metal plates and the suspender allowed for the support of the top metal plates.</p>
