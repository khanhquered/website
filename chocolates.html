			<p>Chocolate Piece by Piece is my idea for an escape room that consists of a giant sliding puzzle made of life-sized chocolates. The game is based off of the sliding puzzles in which players can only move things piece by piece in order to re-create a certain pattern. In this version, players enter a room decorated like what seems to be a life-sized box of chocolates, complete with nutrition facts and chocolate assortment cards lining the wall. In the center is a 4 x 4 grid of chocolates with a missing piece, and players realize they have to slide the chocolates one at a time to recreate a pattern of chocolates on the wall. To create a proof-of-concept, I made a 1:12 scale looks-like model of the sliding chocolates.</p>

			<p>The chocolates were made from chunks of cut blue foam. The foam was covered with spackle and then sanded down to achieve a smooth finish. The piece was hand-painted to look like chocolate. The drizzle on the chocolate pieces were created using hot glue, and toppings consisted of either beads or formed clay. A process picture of a piece of chocolate before adding each individualized topping is shown below.</p>

			<p>The sketch model was a further evolution of previous concept sketches of the room. It combined the two concept sketches shown below, one of truffles which would have been rolled into their spots, and one of a harder version of the game called a pendant puzzle. The model was chosen to achieve a happy medium of feasibility in terms of implementing the actual escape room and appropriate level of difficulty for players.</p>

			<p>The goal of the looks-like model was to explore the creation of realistic-looking chocolate pieces as well as detailing the overall look and feel of the chocolates in the room.
