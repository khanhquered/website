			<p>As a design intern at VERITAS, I spearheaded a collaboration with Royal Selangor <a href="https://us.royalselangor.com/collections?___from_store=0&___store=us" target="_blank">(+)</a> for a collection of pewter products. For the three weeks while I was there, I worked on concept generation, design, 3D modelling, and prototyping the collection. After I left, the companies will take on the project to bring the collection into the product development, production, and sales cycles. I will stay on as a consultant during this period.</p>

			<p>The collection is a set of luxury bathroom products based on the Malayan tiger, the currently-endangered national animal of Malaysia. Some of the sales proceeds will be donated to MyCat, a fund for the Malayan tiger. The collection draws inspiration from the fluidity of the tiger's form and movement. Though large and bulky, tigers still move with grace. The organic shapes of the items are inspired by the flowing tiger form, while the filaments in the design are inspired by the intricate pelage of the tiger. The five items in the collection consist of a soap dish, a reed diffuser, a soap dispenser, a votive holder, and a storage jar. Each item will comprise a glass vessel encased in a pewter sleeve.</p>

			<p>Here is a snapshot of the collection, which is still a work in progress.</p>

			<p>The design process of the collection involved a lot of initial research, paper sketches, and CAD experimentation. Here are a couple of photos of some 3D-printed prototypes.</p>

 			<p>I also created mockup ads for the marketing campaign and animated presentations for client meetings.</p>
