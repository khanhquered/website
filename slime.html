			<p>I conducted a research project on slime stretchiness, cumulating in a final poster presented at a poster session and a final research paper. This was an individual research project as part of MIT's junior year capstone mechanical engineering class. The project had guidance from both mechanical engineering faculty members and outside consumer sources.</p>

			<p>My goal was to optimize slime stretchiness and to discover how altering the slime composition and strain rate affects stretchiness. This can be useful in both the consumer product industry and in novel research applications such as stretchable strain sensors and electrochromic devices. Inspiration from the project came from following consumer slime trends on Instagram and YouTube.</p>

			<p>After conducting background research on slime, I had to figure out how to define stretchiness ("the ability to expand while under tensile stress") and then how to test that stretchiness. I settled on using a stretch test on a texture analyzer. I stretched different samples of slime that I created on the texture analyzer at different strain rates and noted down when they broke. Slime samples were made using different mixtures of polyvinyl acetate, or white glue, broax, and water, with the addition of shaving gel to create a fluffy slime.</p>

			<p>Matlab code was used to analyze the data from the generated force versus distance graphs to find the break lengths, the point at which the force magnitude rapidly decreased to zero. I then graphed histograms of the distributions of break lengths for each strain rate. In order to compare stretchiness, I graphed the fraction of slimes that broke over the strain rate and fit the data to a sigmoidal function, or s-curve. This allowed me to find the critical strain rate, or the rate at which 50% of the slimes are predicted to break. I found that decreasing the amount of borax from the standard recommended slime recipe increased stretchiness. Further research can find the optimal amount of borax, as decreasing it entirely will result in no cross-linking of the polymer chains and thus no slime formation.</p>

			<p>From this project, I was able to apply research to improve an existing consumer product. I learned how to pick an ideal quality of a product and to frame a research question around it, and then how to use existing engineering tools to collect and analyze data that will answer the question.</p>

			<p>I synthesized my results into a poster that was presented at a poster session. I also wrote a research paper that can be found <a href="projects/Final Paper Two Column.pdf">here</a>. (Thumbnails of the first and last pages of the research paper and of the full poster are shown below.)</p>
